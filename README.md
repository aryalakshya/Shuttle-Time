#  Shuttle Time - Badminton Court Booking App

A real-time, web-based application for booking badminton courts, built with React and powered by Firebase. This app allows users to view available time slots for the next day, book a spot for themselves or a group, and manage their upcoming bookings.

##  Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up, sign-in, and password reset functionality using Firebase Authentication.
* **Real-Time Slot Availability:** View court availability for tomorrow in real-time. Slots update instantly for all users when a booking or cancellation occurs.
* **Court Selection:** Easily switch between different courts to view their schedules.
* **Dynamic Booking:** Book one or more spots in an available time slot. The app prevents overbooking and enforces a daily limit of two slots per user.
* **Booking Management:** A personalized "My Bookings" page shows all upcoming bookings for today and tomorrow.
* **Cancellations:** Users can cancel their bookings for the next day, immediately freeing up the slot for others.
* **Live Notifications:** Receive in-app notifications when a previously booked slot becomes available.
* **Responsive Design:** A clean, dark-themed UI that works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

##  Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** React
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
